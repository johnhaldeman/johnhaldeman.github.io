    <title>Working Remote in Windsor, ON</title>

    <summary> The COVID-19 pandemic has turned many people into remote workers – perhaps permanently. If your job has changed to allow you to work remotely, or you are currently a remote worker, this post is for you. Being able to live anywhere has many advantages. I’ll contend that you should pick Windsor, Ontario as your home base. After all, I did nine years ago when I first became a remote worker, and I have no intention of leaving. I came for the cost of living reductions, I stayed because it's a great city in a great area.</summary>
