There are all kinds of sound matching activities, word recognition activities, and other tasks where, if you were teaching someone face-to-face, you would ask them to vocalize.

The task itself isn't as fun as many other activities, but he'll do anything if there's stuff to unlock and click and experiment with. He asks often if he can do some Lexia.

Some of the errors can be corrected based on context with other words used in the command. I tried to tune for maximum forgiveness, but an interesting thing happens when you tell the library to generate more alternatives: it seems to take longer to get results, decreasing responsiveness. There may be a tradeoff here between speed and accuracy. All of this is speculation though as I am no expert in the area and results may be improved with tuning or using a different library or a cloud service.

It will be interesting to try this again when Firefox releases their API as the browsers often leap-frog one another when it comes to improvements to functions.
